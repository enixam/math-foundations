```{theorem second-derivative, name = "Second derivative test for local extrema"}


Suppose $f''(x)$ is continuous on an open interval that contains $x = c$  

1. If $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) > 0$, then $f(x)$ has a local minimum at $x = c$  

2. If $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) < 0$, then $f(x)$ has a local maximum at $x = c$  

3. If $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) = 0$, the the test fails. $f(x)$ my have a local maximum, a local minimum, or neither
