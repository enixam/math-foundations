```{theorem second-derivative, name = "Second derivative test for local extrema"}


Suppose $f''(x)$ is continuous on an open interval that contains $x = c$  

1. If $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) > 0$, then $f(x)$ has a local minimum at $x = c$  

2. If $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) < 0$, then $f(x)$ has a local maximum at $x = c$  

3. If $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) = 0$, the the test fails. $f(x)$ my have a local maximum, a local minimum, or neither

## Convex Functions 

```{definition convex-set, name = "Convext set"}

A set $S$ is said to be convex, if for every pair of points $\bar{w}_1, \bar{w}_2 \in S$, point $\lambda\bar{w}_1 + (1 - \lambda)\bar{w}_2$ must also be in $S$ for all $\lambda \in (0, 1)$ 
```

Intuitively, convexity means if we connect $\bar{w}_1, \bar{w}_2$ with a straight line, then all points along the line must be in set $S$. For example, an open interval $(a, b)$ on the 1-dimensional number line is a convex set. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.with = "120%"}

```

An property of convex set $S$ is that, given $r$ points $\bar{w}_1, ..., \bar{w}_r$ and $r$ nonnegative numbers $\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_r$ such that $\lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_r = 1$ ,the affine combination 

$$
\sum _{i=1}^r\lambda_i\bar{w}_k
$$
belongs to $s$. As the definition of a convex set is the case $r = 2$, this property characterizes convex sets. 

```{definition convex-function, name = "Convex function"}

Let $f(\cdot)$ be a real-valued function with a convex domain, so that if $f(\bar{w}_1), f(\bar{w}_2)$ is defined, for any $\lambda \in (0, 1)$, the expression $f\big( \lambda\bar{w}_1 + (1- \lambda)\bar{w}_2\big)$ is defined. For any $\lambda \in (0, 1)$ and $\bar{w}_1, \bar{w}_2$

- $f$ is called **convex** if 

$$
f\big(\lambda\bar{w}_1 + (1 - \lambda)\bar{w}_2\big) \le \lambda f(\bar{w}_1) + (1-\lambda)f(\bar{w}_2)
$$

- $f$ is called **strictly convex** if 

$$
f\big(\lambda\bar{w}_1 + (1 - \lambda)\bar{w}_2\big) \lt \lambda f(\bar{w}_1) + (1-\lambda)f(\bar{w}_2)
$$
