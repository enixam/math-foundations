# Preface {-}  

This document aims to cover various mathematical topics relevant to machine learning applications, including linear algebra, multivariate calculus, probability theory, and optimization (statistics should be in another stand-alone document). Since it currently serves mainly as review on those subjects, some basic knowledge (especially in multivariate calculus) that are already familiar to me are skipped. Other than that I try to put things in a logical, consistent order.
