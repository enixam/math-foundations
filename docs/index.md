# Preface {-}  

This document aims to collect notes on various mathematical topics relevant to machine learning problems, including linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, and possibly optimization (statistics should be in another stand-alone document). 

The document is generated by the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown].
