# Preface {-}  

This document is an effort to cover from scratch various mathematical knowledge relevant to data science and statistics, including linear algebra, multivariate calculus, probability theory, computational learning theory, and optimization (statistics itself should be in another stand-alone document). Although it's mainly intended for self consumption, I will be very glad if others could find it helpful and welcome any suggestion. 

Here is an short outline of each part

Few comments at the end

- the notes focus on real numbers but many theorems have direct generalization in complex space
