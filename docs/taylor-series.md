# Taylor Series








$$
L(x, y) = f(x_0, y_0) + f_x(x_0, y_0)(x - x_0) + f_y(x_0, y_0)(y - y_0)
$$

The approximation

$$
f(x, y) \approx L(x, y)
$$

is called the **standard linear approximation** of $f$ at $(x_0, y_0)$ 

If $M$ is the upper bound of $|f_{xx}|$, $|f_{yy}|$ and $|f_{xy}|$

$$
\text{error of linearization} \le \frac{1}{2}M(|x - x_0|^2 - |y - y_0|^2)
$$
