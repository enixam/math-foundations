### Gradient and directional derivative  

We want to know the instant rate of change at $P_0 = (x_0, y_0)$, when moving towards the direction $\bar{u} = [u_1, u_2]$ a tiny step of length $h$. 


```{definition directional-derivative, name = "Directional derivative"}

```


$$
\Big(\frac{df}{dh} \Big)_{\bar{u}, P_0}  = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + hu_1, y_0 + hu_2) - f(x_0, y_0)}{h}
$$
The concise version using vector notation is 

$$
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(\bar{x}  +  h\bar{u}) - f(\bar{x})}{h}
$$


$$
x = x_0 + hu_1, \quad y = y_0 + hu_2
$$

$$
\begin{split}
\Big(\frac{df}{dh} \Big)_{\bar{u}, P_0}  &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \biggr |_{P_0} \frac{dx}{dh} +      \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \biggr |_{P_0} \frac{dy}{dh} \\
&= \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \biggr |_{P_0}u_1 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \biggr |_{P_0}u_2 \\
&= \nabla f |_{P_0} \cdot \bar{u}
\end{split}
$$


## Differentails 

We first review the definition of differential in single variable calculus. In single variable calculus, the change in function $f$ as $x$ changes from $a$ to $a + \Delta x$ is 
$$
\Delta y = f(a + \Delta x) - f(a)
$$

The corresponding change in the tangent line $L$ at from $a$ to $a + \Delta x$ is 

$$
\begin{split}
\Delta L &= \underbrace{f(a) + f'(a)(a + \Delta x - a)}_{L(a + \Delta x)} - \underbrace{f(a)}_{L(a)} \\
&= f'(a)\Delta x
\end{split}
$$


When $\Delta x$ is a infinitely small number $dx$ (but nonzero), we can use $\Delta L$ to approximate $\Delta y$. In such case, let $dy$ or $df$ represents the the amount the tangent line rises or falls when $x$ changes by an tiny amount $\Delta x = dx$. This amount is called a differential. In other words, the differential $dy$ is the change $\Delta L$ in the linearization of $f$ when $x = a$ changes by an amount $dx$.  

Now let $a$ be any point $x$ in $f$'s domain, the differential $dy$ (or $df$) is

$$
dy = f'(x)\Delta x
$$
